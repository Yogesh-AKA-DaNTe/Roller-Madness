# Roller Madness

This is a Hyper Casual 3D game **Roller Madness** made in _Unity (2018.4.36f1)_.
You control a Cyan Ball and your goal is to collect a specified amount of Yellow Coins to clear the level.
If you touch the Green Structures then you will bounce off them, and if you touch the Red Zone outside the play area then you will die and the game will be over.
There is no time limit but you cannot relax and collect the coins slowly because after a certain amount of time passes, enemies which looks like Purple Boxes will appear and start hunting you. If they catch you then again it is Game Over.
